# medical-clinic-system
Interview assignment for Esatto Poland.

## Description
The project is a simple medical clinic system. It allows to manage patients. 
The system is able to add, edit, delete and list patients. The system is also able 
to search for patients by their PESEL number.

# IMPORTANT EDIT:
I sincerily apologize, as I have accidentally deleted one empty component before final commit.
In order for the application to work, you need to delete imports and calls in lines :2 and :26 in Homepage.tsx (import Decoration).
I understand, if it doesn't meet requirements, editing this readme is the most I can do now, I hope. (readme edited 31.03.2024).

## HOW TO RUN
To run the project you need to open 2 terminals. In the first terminal you need to run the server:
- Go to the server directory: `cd server`
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run the server: `npm run dev`

In the second terminal you need to run the client:
- Go to the client directory: `cd client`
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run the client: `npm start`

Then you can open the browser and go to `http://localhost:5173/` to see the application.
